### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
##### To create software that’s easily maintained, read and adaptable I create software that’s easily transferred and modular. For example, the crud module used in Project three is easily interchanged with project one and Project two for reading, updating, and deleting data from the database. Working modularly increases production time and creates apps that are easily troubleshot and remedied.

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
##### To approach software as a computer scientist I use primary critical thinking. I start by analyzing the challenge. After understanding the requirements, I’m able to interpret different solutions and decide what works best to solve the challenge. With this I develop test cases with pass and fail metrics for each of my requirements. With the test cases, I’m able to develop tool to tackle the challenges and implement the test cases and debug my new application. I will continue to use this method to develop quality applications and software.

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
##### Computer scientists find a challenge, interpret the challenge, and test their solution. This process is important to Creating quality usable software to deliver to a client. Without trying to create a solution to a challenge there is no way to learn and grow from the experience.  Software that’s developed modularly creates a short cut for companies later, it makes modules that are easily replaced or implemented elsewhere. Saving time and space for companies like Grazioso Salvare.
